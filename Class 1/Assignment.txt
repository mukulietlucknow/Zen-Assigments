Http 1.1 :-
In Http 1.1 lot of feature has been introduced like
	1. CORS has been introduced 
	2. Keep alive action has been introduced

There were flaws in the http 1.1 thos eare as follows:
	1. Repeatition of the header data.
	2. More focus on the minifying the css and js etc
	3. More focus on the gzip
	4. It used to create the max of 6 connection to the server to the client
	

Those flaws has been solved in the http 2.0
	1. Http 2.0 create one tcp conection but it uses stream of the data in the request
	2. And https is mandatory for the http 2.0 so it is more secure
	3. HAPCk - here header data is separate from the request data. And also can be zipped.it also
	Cache the headr data
	4. Hpack also reduces the request size
	5. PUSH - it also ppushes the mandatory data along with the index.html data
	6. Also it is built on http 1.1

what happens when you type a URL in the address bar in the browser?
		a. When we type first the address then this address goes to ISP via router to DNS and then DNS give the ip addresss of the url to the ISP 
		b. ISP provide IP to the browser and then brower do the request to the direct machine where our desired HTML document is present and then HTML data ccomes 		with the other content to the browser and it gets rendred
